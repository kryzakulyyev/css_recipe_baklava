            Our test kitchen gave this its highest rating. It can be made weeks
            in advance, frozen, and then baked the day before the party. You can
            also omit pistachios and use 1 pound walnuts, if desired. If butter
            hardens as you layer the baklava, microwave briefly on LOW to
            liquefy it.

            <h2>How to Make It</h2>
            <br />

            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>
              Preheat oven to 300°. Chop pistachios in a food processor a few
              seconds until finely chopped. Add walnuts, 2/3 cup sugar, and
              cinnamon, and process until the texture of coarse meal; pulse out
              any lumps. Set aside.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>
              Lightly fit 1 phyllo sheet in the bottom of a lightly greased 13-
              x 9-inch baking dish; trim phyllo to fit, if necessary. Brush well
              with melted butter. Fit 7 more phyllo sheets in dish, brushing
              each layer well with melted butter.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
              Scatter a generous 1/3 cup nut mixture over phyllo. Add 2 more
              phyllo sheets, brushing each with melted butter, then another 1/3
              cup nut mixture. Continue layering phyllo and nut mixture,
              brushing each sheet with butter, until all nut mixture is used.
              Top with remaining phyllo sheets, brushing each with melted
              butter. Place baklava in freezer 10 minutes. (This makes it easier
              to cut.)
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>
              Slice baklava in a 2-inch-wide, diamond-shaped pattern. (At this
              point, baklava may be frozen: Wrap pan with heavy-duty aluminum
              foil, label and date, and freeze.)
            </p>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>
              Set baking dish on middle oven rack, and place a shallow pan of
              water on rack underneath. Bake at 300° for 2 hours and 10 minutes
              or until golden brown. (Bake frozen baklava, uncovered, in same
              way at 300° for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until golden brown.)

          It turned out amazing and it was not hard to make. It was a little
          tedious but it is well worth the work!
